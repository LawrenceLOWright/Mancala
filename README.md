Mancala

By Quinn Callahan, Ben Kiel, and Lawrence Wright

Files: 
Mancala.cpp -> the file that contains all of the game's programming
resources -> a folder of assets used in the game. Necessary for the game to run.
Mancala_Time.exe -> the game's executable. 

How to run the game:
Download the resources folder and Mancala.cpp, then double click Mancala Time.exe

We've also emailed the whole zip file of the game from the email Qcallaha@oberlin.edu if the alternatives to running the game don't work. The zip file is called game-premake-main.zip. To get to the executable from the zip file go to _bin -> Debug -> game-premake-main.exe .

Known bugs:
There is a rare occurrence when clicking a spot that far too many beads are added to the score pit. When we've seen it happen it seems that it directly adds the beads from the clicked pit into the score pit. We believe this can also happen on the computer's turn.

The game rarely sometimes crashes when the computer takes its turn. The cause of this is currently unknown.

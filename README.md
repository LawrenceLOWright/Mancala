Mancala

By Quinn Callahan, Ben Kiel, and Lawrence Wright

Files: 
Mancala.cpp -> the file that contains all of the game's programming
resources -> a folder of assets used in the game. Necessary for the game to run.
Mancala_Time.exe -> the game's executable. 

How to run the game:
Download the resources folder and Mancala.cpp, then double click Mancala_Time.exe

If you want to run the source code directly (not recommended),  you'll have to download Visual Studio, Raylib, go into the code, click "build" on the top bar, click "build game premake main," which will generate a "game premake main" exe file. Double click that exe file to run!

Known bugs:
None!
